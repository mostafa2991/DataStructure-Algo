	/*
	 * how array located in memory
	 * when u intialize array int i = new int [3];
	 * compiler allocate 3 cells in ram
	 * you don't know that where is the cells but it's for sure gonna be next to each other
	 * they are located to each other which make them very fast to access the elements
	 * 2 dimention array goona be as 1 dim array in memory physically  the same like 3 dim
	 * 
	 * To create an array u need 
	 * 1- Declare => sys will only create refrence
	 * 2- Instantiate => compiler will allocate memory + assign default values + get the address of first cell put it into the reffrence
	 * 3- Initialized  => 
	 *
	 * nothing called delete the cell of array
	 * you just make the value of the cell = 0 but the cell is already there
	 * 
	 *
